<h1>A Simple JavaScript Calculator</h1>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome! This is a tutorial on how to develop a simple JS calculator using HTML, CSS and basic JS concepts.</p>
<h3>How to reproduce this</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Create the HTML layout of your buttons</li>
	<li>Style them (it doesn't have to be perfect, as long as it looks decent)</li>
	<li>Add JS</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to create your JS file</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Extract all of the buttons and their values using <code>const [insert btn name] = document.getElementById("insert ID name of button")</code> and <code>[insert btn name].value</code></li>
	<li></li>
	<li></li>
</ol>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<p>Currently, it's only possible to use the buttons, as the input does not work. Nonetheless, it works like any other simple calculator out there.</p>
